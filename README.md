## **Methodology**

### **Wavefunction Approach**

The wavefunction method represents numbers as points on wavefunctions corresponding to prime frequencies. By analyzing the behavior of these wavefunctions, we can identify prime numbers based on their unique patterns.

### **Square Wave Method**

- **Concept**: Generates square waves with periods corresponding to prime numbers.
- **Characteristics**:
  - Sharp transitions between high and low values.
  - Highlights multiples of primes by dips in the wave amplitude.
- **Implementation**:
  - Uses the `scipy.signal.square` function to create square waves.
  - Superimposes waves for multiple primes to enhance detection.

---

### **Cosine Wave Method**

- **Concept**: Generates cosine waves adjusted to have zeros at multiples of prime numbers.
- **Characteristics**:
  - Smooth oscillations suitable for spectral analysis.
  - Emphasizes the periodicity associated with prime numbers.
- **Implementation**:
  - Uses the `numpy.cos` function with phase shifts.
  - Summation of cosine waves to create a composite function.

---

## **Results and Analysis**

The superposition of wavefunctions reveals patterns that correlate with the distribution of prime numbers.

### **Visualization**

- Plots of the composite wavefunctions show distinct behaviors at prime and composite numbers.
- Negative amplitudes often correspond to composite numbers, while peaks or zeros may indicate primes.

---

### **Observations**

- The square wave method provides clear markers for multiples of primes.
- The cosine wave method offers smoother transitions and can be further analyzed using Fourier transforms.

---

### **Limitations**

- The accuracy depends on the number of primes included and the chosen threshold values.
- Numerical errors and drift may affect results over large ranges.
